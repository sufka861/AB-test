**Welcome to our part in SAAS-System!**

You can reuse the portrayal you used first because this section should not be long.)
How It Works? You can create and run the AB test and make a features of features according to the features you choose and the amount of traffic you will participate in the experiment.
You can see the statistics of each experiment depending on the amount of participants while running and at the end of the project.
The purpose of this project is to identify any change in the webpage to maximize or increase the result of the matter. An example can be identifying the clicks lesson for a banner ad.

> **Before you start**
1. [x] Download the code from Git-Hub https://github.com/sufka861/AB-test.git
2. [x] Cd to the working directory and start the server using the following command in the terminal - $node app.js
3. [x] Make sure to install npm packages [npm install] as described in the package.json:
   8.[x] body-parser
   9.[x] bson
   10.[x] cookie-parser
   11.[x] cors
   12.[x] dotenv
   13.[x] eslint
   14.[x] express
   15.[x] express-async-errors
   16.[x] geoip-lite
   17.[x] moment
   18.[x] mongodb
   19.[x] mongoose
   15.[x] morgan
   16.[x] newrelic
   17.[x] node-cron
   18.[x] request-ip

24. [x] Open a browser page and go to https://ab-test-bvtg.onrender.com/
25. [x] Make sure you have our .env file containing the sensitive info of our system account.

> **API reference**

 Full documentation of the API calls can be seen at: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/24139741/2s8Z711C7C
9. [x] http calls logger - configured in the middleware directory, writes call logs inside logs folder, filename: http.log
10.[x] error logs - configured in the middleware directory, writes call logs inside logs folder, filename: error.log. operates from the errorHandler middleware (info will follow)
11.[x] error handler - consists of 3 parts:
12.[x] express-async-errors package - wraps the controllers in try/catch statement automatically (no implementation needed), and calls the next(error) function in the catch block with the error thrown. the next function will "fall" into the errorHandler.
13.[x] errorHandler - a function that is used at the end of the server that catches all the errors thrown in the controllers
14.[x] Custom Errors - in the errors' directory. Classes that extends Error class, with status and message to pass to the error handier at the end. More can be added if we need them.


> **Instructions**
1. [x] Using the calls to the render website via Postman you can create and start AB test / Feature Flag experiments.
2. [x] View lists of exist experiments and planned future experiments.
3. [x] app.js  â€“ the entry point of the system
4. [x] Router â€“ consists of a map of all the API points for both server and client
5. [x] Controllers â€“ direct the functionality of the system6.
6. [x] Services â€“ contain the business logic of the system.
7. [x] Data Base â€“ MongoDB.
8. [x] repositories .
9. [x] middleware â€“ contain all the error and logs functions.
10.[x] models â€“ contain the schemas  that connects to the database through mongoose.

> **Tests**>

 All tests were done using Mocha,Chai and sinos.
you can find all the tests under the folder "test".
 use [npm run test] to run all the test and check coverage and results.

> **How to Use**

NOTE!pay attention to the account type - 
 - exclusive - the account have the option to choose - Does each experiment stand by itself and only one experiment will appear for each.
 - Inclusive - This means that every customer has a lot of experiments
And all the experiments together can be together for all the weird who sees them.

   * Duration
   * choose 3 attributes and costume attribute.
   * traffic
   * variants - 3
   * goal
4. Click on "Create" button.
5. . A message show "Your Experiment has been successfully saved"
6. Go to "Manage Experiments" and check that the experiment that you creat appears.
7. check the type experiment is Feature Flag.

`Edit Experiment:`

1. Open Homepage.html.
2. Go to "Mange Experiment" page.
3. choose an exist experiment and click on "Edit" button.
4. Open Edit Experiment page.
5. Delete one of the Values in the form (leave it empty)
6. Click on "Update" button.
7. Go to "Manage Experiments" and check that change that you make has been changed in the experiment.


`Experiment Status:`

1. Open Homepage.html.
2. Go to "Edit Experiment" page and create new experiment that start time in the current time.
3. Go to "Mange Experiment" page.
4. Check that the experiment status is "Active"
5. Click on "Terminated" button.
6. Check that the experiment status changed to "Terminated".

`Experiment Duration:`
